# Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs)
This repository contains implementations of various Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) models using the Keras deep learning framework. The models are applied to different datasets and feature diverse architectures to explore and demonstrate the potential of VAEs in the fields of neural compression and generative modeling.

# End-to-End $\beta$-VAE_MNIST
$\beta$-Variational Autoencoder of MNIST in Keras

The provided script includes the required code for creating, training, and evaluating a **$\beta$-Variational Autoencoder ($\beta$-VAE)** using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset comprises grayscale images of handwritten digits ranging from `0` to `9`, each with dimensions of `28` by `28` pixels. The **Keras** framework was employed in this project.
